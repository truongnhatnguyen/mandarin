There is only Chernarus – 230 square kilometers of post-Soviet country that was struck by an unknown virus, which turned the majority of its population into raging infected.\n- Your task? To survive the collapse of civilization for as long as you possibly can. Keep in mind that death is permanent in unforgiving Chernarus. All you’ll have when you start over again are the memories of your final mistake.\n+ Meet Others..Up to 60 players are struggling to survive by any means necessary at any given time. Make friends, kill on sight, build a base, or risk being betrayed over a can of tasty beans. Use VOIP to interact with other players however you see fit. Every encounter is meaningful when your life is always on the line. Be wary. Stay alert. Trust no one.\n+ Survive Chernarus..- The infected aren’t the only ones you need to worry about – there’s also the wildlife and elements. Evade packs of wolves and frenzied bears, find shelter from the punishing rain, search for light in the darkness of night. You’ll also need to master complex survival mechanics concerning your hunger, thirst, body temperature, and more.\n+ Loot Up..- Always make sure your gear is ready. Patch up damaged clothes, craft improvised items, and head out to deceptively dead cities to scavenge for valuable resources. Fix a car and hide it in your secret base under a cover of well-placed traps. Step into contaminated zones if you dare and keep your eyes peeled for precious loot. Don’t forget that you won’t get far without a full hazard suit and gas mask.\n+ Take your Shot..- Intense PvP action can break out anywhere at any time, especially in hotspots like abandoned military bases, where heart-pounding firefights are all the rage. Some survivors want your loot, others are simply hunting for sport. Then there are those who are afraid you’ll shoot first. Learn how to fight and know when the time has come to swallow your pride and flee. One bullet can change absolutely everything. Always watch your back.\n+ Install Mods..+ Head on over to the Steam Workshop and find a customized server that fits. Join an active community of like-minded players and modify your DayZ experience to suit your taste. Browse thousands of fan-made features, maps, and guns – all of which are easily managed directly from the game launcher.",

  "about": "Hellish Quart is a physics-based sword fighting game set in 17th century Poland. With motion-captured fencing techniques and four gamepad buttons representing four attack angles, you'll need to use timing, technique, and speed to defeat your opponents. Choose from a variety of warriors and fight in arcade mode, quick fights, survival mode, or local multiplayer. If you want to hone your sword fighting skills, you can spar with wooden weapons or train in modern HEMA gear. And for the ultimate experience, Hellish Quart also offers an optional VR mode.\nPlease note that the game is still in development and only supports local multiplayer.. In Early Access, the game's text and dialogues are translated to non-English languages by an automatic system. The translations may be imprecise at this stage, but will be later corrected by hand.\n- Physical Sword Fighting using Active Ragdolls..- Super realistic, motion captured fencing animations..- Challenging boss fight..- Optional VR mode.\nHellish Quart utilizes active ragdolls and real-time physics to get you the ultimate fencing experience. You can attack from four different angles using the four gamepad buttons. Different button combinations enable special attacks and combos. When you are not attacking, your character automatically assumes a defensive stance, blocking your opponent's attacks using the autoguard feature. Proper timing, technique, speed, measure, and wits are all crucial to winning, just like in real-world fencing.\nThe game is set in the historical 17th-century Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the character models are based on 3D-scanned reconstructed clothes from that period. The single-player campaign, once completed, will be firmly rooted in the reality of life in the region. You will duel against Zaporozhian Cossacks, Polish Hussars, Tatars, Turkish Janissaries, Swedish Reiters, French Musketeers, and more.",

  "about": "- AUTHENTIC GAMEPLAY..With the dual stick controls, each stick represents one of your feet. You will need to learn how to control them and transfer weight, just like on a real skateboard. The physics have been developed with a focus on realism, smoothness and immersion. Just like in real life for a new skateboarder, the first hours can seem challenging, but once you have mastered the technique, you will feel the unrivalled thrill of pulling off your very first kickflip! Session: Skate Sim also includes full options customisation, so you can enjoy the perfect experience tailored to you. A full tutorial provides all the help you need to get started, and you can choose from four difficulty levels!.\n- THE 1990S AND SKATE CULTURE..Inspired by the golden age of street skating – the 1990s – Session: Skate Sim lets you experience true skateboarding and its culture: no scoring system; just you, your spot and your imagination! There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots.\n- IF IT WASN'T CAUGHT ON VIDEO, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN..Skating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no one is there to film it, it didn't really happen… In Session: Skate Sim, you can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.). Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of view of your camera operator and create the best clip.\n- CUSTOMISATION..Show off your style with an extensive customisation system for your skater and skateboard. By completing challenges, you earn money to spend in skate shops. You can find nearly 200 items (hoodies, shoes, caps, T-shirts, trousers, etc.) from top brands, such as Fallen, Zero, GrindKing, Thankyou, HIJINX Net, Antilanta, Roger Skate CO, No-Comply, iDabble and others. You can also customise your skateboard with over 250 parts, such as wheels, trucks and many other components from famous brands like, No-Comply, GindKing, Thankyou and many others. In addition to the design aspect, the components (trucks, riser pads, wheels…) impact the way you skate. Find the right ones for your style and shred the most iconic spots!",

  "about": "This region of the Rocky Mountains has captivated the imagination of many, who have sought to uncover its bounties. Where once people scouted the natural trails of Silver Ridge Peaks in search of silver and gold, they now come seeking a different kind of trophy - to hunt their favourite animals. Whether you are tracking turkeys through the valley or lining up to shoot a mountain goat on a cliff above the cloudline, it's hard to resist taking in the grandeur of the Colorado wilderness.\n- SILVER RIDGE PEAKS’ FAUNA..Silver Ridge Peaks prides itself in the range of animals available to visiting hunters. Whether you are stalking through the boundless grassy plains in pursuit of Pronghorn, keeping an eye out for stalking Mountain Lions or observing Rocky Mountain Elk traverse the dense forests, the reserve has something for every hunter. The ferocious Black Bear is a popular attraction, as are the Mule Deer, Plains Bison, Mountain Goat and Bighorn Sheep. But the real attraction is a little more feathery; hunters are known to flock to the reserve in search of Wild Turkeys.\n- ROCKY MOUNTAIN FLORA..Boasting a dramatic landscape that can easily take your breath away, the reserve takes great pride in its more elusive spots that can make visitors feel like they’re stepping back in time. From the mine and ghost town’s reminders of the past, to the cloud-piercing Red Mountains, the reserve is packed with marvels. As you roam the deep canyon or gaze upon the high altitude lakes, you can’t help but get lost in its beauty.\n- TRADITIONAL STYLE ALEXANDER LONGBOW..Through the use of contemporary bow-making techniques and flexible but sturdy materials, this Longbow is a stunning take on an ancient self bow, making it effective even for modern hunters. Compatible with the arrows used for the recurve bow as well as introducing two new types, the Alexander Longbow allows you to hunt animals of all sizes. A single stave of hickory and bowstring combine to form a silent but deadly weapon that epitomizes the resourcefulness of the peoples who used it to conquer prey.\nThe longbow is available in three colour variations: Lacquered, Rough and Ash.\n- MISSIONS AND MEASURES..Silver Ridge Peaks spans an impressive 25 square miles (64 square kilometers), and it is up to you to decide if you wish to explore the landscape at your own discretion, or pursue the story with 15 new narrative missions.\nThe history of Silver Ridge Peaks is as rich in legends of human endeavour and adventure as it is in studies of brutal expansion and mankind’s greed. Miners risked their lives to travel great distances during Colorado’s silver boom. Much of the landscape was blasted into its current shape, with only one consideration: the pursuit of money.\nThe consequences of such single-minded profiteering have finally arrived, landing at the feet of the reserve’s latest warden: Allan Bradley. As he attempts to fill the shoes of his ailing father, Allan must repair the reserve’s reputation following a toxic spill from a century-old mine, and show the world that Silver Ridge Peaks is stepping forward into the future. Along with fellow hunter Remi Warren, it’s your job to show that there’s nowhere better to hunt than in the shadows of the Rocky Mountains.\n- SHARED EXPERIENCE..Try out Silver Ride Peaks without owning it by simply joining a multiplayer session of another player who owns the reserve. You will have access to everything but the narrative missions.",

Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh desert. Train your men up from puny victims to master warriors. Carry your wounded squad mates to safety and get them all home alive.\n+ FEATURES..- Freeform gameplay in a seamless game world in the largest single-player RPG world since Daggerfall, stretching over 870 square kilometers. The game will never seek to limit you or restrict your personal play style.\n- Custom design as many characters as you want and build up a whole squad to fight for you. Characters will grow and become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their appearance too.\n- Build a base where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear.\n- Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre. No hero characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a life.\n- You are not the chosen one. You're not great and powerful. You don't have more 'hitpoints' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it.\n- Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business.\n- Variation and possibilities of gameplay. Be good, be evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city. Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself.\n- Dynamic, ever changing world. Support or hinder whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won't stop moving. This is not just a game, you are living and surviving in a simulated world.\n- Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive, or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength.\n- Absolutely no Level-scaling. The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don't change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won't hold your hand or help you when you're down.\n- Realistic medical system that affects gameplay. A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A character’s stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation.\n- Intelligent AI that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and carry their wounded to safety. Characters can be setup to take care of micromanagement for you and run production in your base.\n- Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh environment.\n- Independently developed with no design influences, or alterations dictated by men in gray suits who have never played a game before in their lives.\n- Original game world. There are no fantasy-knock-off cliches. No magic.\n",

Conquer territories and fly your colors!.\n+ A struggle for land where new strategies are born: from points to planes!..- The vast land of China is represented a single realistic map, with the characteristics of the land replicated beautifully in CG. The vast map is comprised of 46 cities and approximately 340 regions. The regions are collections of detailed territories, and the struggle for land is intuitively expressed through a color scheme. Players can conquer territories to unite the land and fly their colors more elaborately and more freely.\n+ New strategies created by supply lines and maintaining the front line..- When troops are on the march, and the march origin city is connected to land controlled by the players’ forces, the supply lines will be maintained and troops can battle with ample supplies provided to them. However, if the connection with the march origin city is cut, the troops will lose their supply lines and will be weakened and fall into a disorderly state. Securing the supply lines is an integral part in maintaining the battle front.\n+ Administration changes completely by doctrine and a unique policy!..- Players can organize the administration, the center of power, as an element that expands the player's strategy. Administration is shown in an organization chart, and as retained officers are added to the organization, various commands and effects are obtained. It is important to make administration that suits your own strategy.\n+ More than 150 “characters” and over 1,000 officers – the most in the series!..- More than 1,000 unique officers, which is the largest in the series, are in the game, and each officer is given a “character” (trait). There are more than 150 characters, with some being useful in battle, some in administration and so on. Some officers possess a powerful and unique character, and arranging the right officer in the right place will help in shortening the path to conquering territories.",

Choose from four unique, varied factions and wage war your way – mounting a campaign of conquest to save or destroy a vast and vivid fantasy world.\n- This is a game of two halves – one a turn-based open-world campaign, and the other intense, tactical real-time battles across the fantastical landscapes of the New World.\n- Play how you choose – delve into a deep engrossing campaign, experience unlimited replayability and challenge the world in multiplayer with a custom army of your favourite units. Total War: WARHAMMER II offers hundreds of hours of gameplay and no two games are the same.\n+ World-Spanning Conquest..- Engage in statecraft, diplomacy, exploration and build your empire, turn by turn. Capture, build and manage teeming settlements and recruit vast armies. Level up Legendary Lords and Heroes and arm them with mythical weapons and armour. Negotiate alliances or declare Total War to subjugate any that stand between you and your goal.\n+ Epic Real-Time Battles..- Command thousands-strong legions of soldiers in intense tactical battles. Send forth ferocious, twisted monsters, fire-breathing dragons and harness powerful magic. Utilise military strategies, lay ambushes, or use brute force to turn the tide of combat and lead your forces to victory.\n- The second in a trilogy and sequel to the award-winning Total War: WARHAMMER, Total War: WARHAMMER II brings players a breath-taking new narrative campaign, set across the vast continents of Lustria, Ulthuan, Naggaroth and the Southlands. The Great Vortex Campaign builds pace to culminate in a definitive and climactic endgame, an experience unlike any other Total War title to date.\n- Playing as one of 8 Legendary Lords across 4 iconic races from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, players must succeed in performing a series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt The Great Vortex, while foiling the progress of the other races.\n- Each Legendary Lord has a unique geographical starting position, and each race offers a distinctive new playstyle with unique campaign mechanics, narrative, methods of war, armies, monsters, Lores of Magic, legendary characters, and staggering new battlefield army abilities.\n- Shortly after launch, owners of both the original game and Total War™ WARHAMMER II will gain access to the colossal third campaign. Exploring a single open-world epic map covering the Old World and the New World, players may embark on monumental campaigns as any owned Race from both titles.\n+ Conquer the world, together..- Each of the Races in Total War™ WARHAMMER II will be playable in single and multiplayer campaign, plus custom and multiplayer battles. As the two Legendary Lords for each race all have their own unique campaign start positions, you’ll be able to play a 2-player co-op campaign as the same race. If you own both parts 1 and 2, you’ll be able to play in multiplayer as any of the races you own.\n+ The World of Total War: WARHAMMER II..- Millennia ago, besieged by a Chaos invasion, a conclave of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin.\n- Powerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor.\n- Prince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent.\n- Atop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria. He, too, is intent on preventing cataclysm, though the methods of The Old Ones must prevail.\n- The Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes spew forth from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks. He tastes great weakness in the vortex – and great opportunity in its demise.\n- Meanwhile the Skaven, led by Queek Headtaker, stir in their foetid subterranean tunnels. There they multiply unchecked and look hungrily towards the surface, their motives obscured. The time for revelation is nigh….\n- Four races, four outcomes, a single goal: control of the Great Vortex, for good or ill.",

Begin each journey with your chosen tribe Leader, each gifted with different randomised skills and stats, before mapping out your chosen path into the unforgiving frosty landscape.\n- Rescue and recruit frozen companions you find along the way, unearth lost treasures, and spend your hard-earned blings with travelling merchants. The decisions you make and routes you take during each run will help craft a powerful deck, unique to you each time you play.\n- Collect a huge array of cute, but mighty card companions, as well as handy items and clunker cards to aid you in battle. Experiment with different elemental card combinations to find your winning formula.\n- Your companion cards aren’t just disposable minions for dealing out damage; upgrade and customise your favourites by adding wobbly charms to enhance their powers, making your deck a powerful (and adorable) force to be reckoned with!.\n- Plan ahead with the help of a dynamic counter system to map out your next move and fend off frosty foes. While Wildfrost battles are turn-based, cards don’t attack every turn. Instead they have a ‘counter’ which counts down the amount of turns until they’re ready to automatically make their move!.\n- By keeping an eye on enemy monsters’ counters, you can plot ahead your perfect play. Buff your companions? Stall an enemy attack? Or maybe count down your own timer to wreak havoc fast! It’s up to you to strategically turn the tide in your favour.\n- Need a rest? Take shelter in the cosy town of Snowdwell. Here survivors have gathered to keep warm using the power of the Luminice, a giant shard of hot ice.\n- As you progress after each run you’ll be able to return and gradually help expand the hub town itself, constructing buildings such as a Pet Shop, Inventors Hut and more! These new areas will unlock fun and useful new things to use during your adventures, with new cards, tribes, cosmetics, challenges to complete, and events to encounter.",

  "about": "Triumph over the land, take charge of the fate of China! Conquer territories and fly your colors!.\nA struggle for land where new strategies are born: from points to planes!..The vast land of China is represented a single realistic map, with the characteristics of the land replicated beautifully in CG. The vast map is comprised of 46 cities and approximately 340 regions. The regions are collections of detailed territories, and the struggle for land is intuitively expressed through a color scheme. Players can conquer territories to unite the land and fly their colors more elaborately and more freely.\nNew strategies created by supply lines and maintaining the front line..When troops are on the march, and the march origin city is connected to land controlled by the players’ forces, the supply lines will be maintained and troops can battle with ample supplies provided to them. However, if the connection with the march origin city is cut, the troops will lose their supply lines and will be weakened and fall into a disorderly state. Securing the supply lines is an integral part in maintaining the battle front.\nAdministration changes completely by doctrine and a unique policy!..Players can organize the administration, the center of power, as an element that expands the player's strategy. Administration is shown in an organization chart, and as retained officers are added to the organization, various commands and effects are obtained. It is important to make administration that suits your own strategy.\nMore than 150 “characters” and over 1,000 officers – the most in the series!..More than 1,000 unique officers, which is the largest in the series, are in the game, and each officer is given a “character” (trait). There are more than 150 characters, with some being useful in battle, some in administration and so on. Some officers possess a powerful and unique character, and arranging the right officer in the right place will help in shortening the path to conquering territories.\nNote: The ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS XIV: Diplomacy and Strategy Expansion Pack Bundle, which is a set that includes the combined content of ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS XIV and the ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS XIV: Diplomacy and Strategy Expansion Pack is also available for purchase. Be careful to avoid making a redundant purchase.\nNote: Both ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS XIV, as well as the ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS XIV Digital Deluxe Edition, which includes the Season Pass are on sale.

  "about": "Wildermyth is a character-driven, procedurally-generated tactical RPG. Like the best tabletop roleplaying experiences, Wildermyth gives you choices and answers your every decision with consequences that drive your characters forward.\nLead a band of heroes as they grow from reluctant farmers into unique, legendary fighters. Combat unexpected threats and strange monsters across interactive battlefields. Unravel mysteries and share pensive moments in an ever-new fantasy setting that blends hard truths and sacrifice with humor and personal storytelling.\nWhere does your myth lead? Come help us uncover it!.\n- Reminiscent of tabletop roleplaying, unique heroes are born in unique settings every game. They age, transform, fall in love, disagree, and make harrowing sacrifices..- Each hero brings their own organic history and personality with them, but your choices and combat skills are what decide their paths and outcomes..- All heroes die someday… but you get to hold on to your favorites. Reintroduce them in the next adventure, and over many lifetimes the myths you make will form your own legendary pantheon.\n+ An Imaginative Papercraft World.- The Yondering Lands, where the game is set, is a richly layered world populated with hand-painted 2D characters and scenery. We’ve paid loving attention to breaking molds and exploring new ideas: no orcs, elves, or goblins here—but watch out for the telepathic insect-dragons and the clockwork undead.+ Extreme Character Depth.- Each of your heroes has their own unique generated history, personality, and appearance, and will form relationships with your other heroes. All of these elements change and develop over the course of a playthrough, as characters age, encounter mysteries, and overcome challenges.\n+ Choices That Matter.- Your hero may choose to trust the enigmatic wolf god, leading to a hair-raising change in their appearance and combat abilities. Or they may pursue a romance with a fellow hero, giving each of them a shared buff and more story opportunities. Encounters and events have permanent, character-defining effects, letting you craft the arc of each character.\n+ A New Approach to Death.- Did your favorite character get one-shotted by a tentacled horror-bear? Choose to let a hero fall back with a maiming that will lead to some transformative new paths in their legend, or let them go out in a blaze of glory to be remembered for generations to come.\n+ Deep and Creative Tactical Combat.- Combat in Wildermyth emphasizes teamwork and careful positioning, as well as imaginative use of your evolving capabilities and surroundings. Walling and Flanking mechanics provide clear but conflicting incentives, while mystical interfusion lets you remake the battlefield with explosive magic. Multiple difficulty levels mean you can get as intense as you want to.\n+ Cooperative Multiplayer.- In a multiplayer game, you and your friends can each customize and control your own heroes as you play through a campaign. Recommended for up to five players—though in a typical campaign, you start with three heroes and pick up the fourth and fifth along the way. We also support Steam Remote Play.\n+ Endless Replayability.- Pick and choose from a huge bank of combat abilities as your heroes level up in each playthrough, and decide whether you prefer offensive or defensive tactics, brute strength, stealth, or magically flinging fire from a nearby lamp into your enemies' faces. Procedural generation gives you new heroes, new enemies, new story events, and new maps every time you play.\n+ A Custom Pantheon of Legends.- You’ll have the freedom to customize hero appearances, names, histories, and more. As time passes, heroes grow old and may retire, or else might fall in combat—and yes, some will survive all the way to the end. You can add your favorite heroes to a roster of legends and call on them again in later playthroughs. Build your own mythologies and share the awe-inspiring might of your heroes with others.",

Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where one player takes on the role of the savage Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught, tortured and killed.\n Survivors play in third-person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey.\n The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play.\nMore information about the game is available at http://www.deadbydaylight.com.+ Key Features.• Survive Together… Or Not - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground?..• Where Am I? - Each level is procedurally generated, so you’ll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play..• A Feast for Killers - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killer’s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims..• Deeper and Deeper - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer..• Real People, Real Fear - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it’s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what’s hiding in the fog.",

Demacia is ripe for a revolution, but can you rise to the challenge of leading it? It’s up to you to find mages across the land and recruit them to your cause. Harness the power of your growing army to upgrade your base and unlock unique abilities.\n Forge Your Legacy.

  "about": "You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization’s last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.\nBut the wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.\nBeavers, lizards, and foxes stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group’s strengths as you balance varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest.\nExperience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build new settlements and collect valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to settlements, but they also reshape the world and open new opportunities for growth.\nWith hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 5 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with settlement “builds” — rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruins. Mix and match ingredients to take advantage of the resources at hand. You never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest hold treasures, resources… and ancient threats.\nLaying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city builder game. In Against the Storm, you’ll have the opportunity to repeatedly create new settlements, while still interacting and trading with previously established cities in a growing world.\n",

There is only Chernarus – 230 square kilometers of post-Soviet country that was struck by an unknown virus, which turned the majority of its population into raging infected.\nYour task? To survive the collapse of civilization for as long as you possibly can. Keep in mind that death is permanent in unforgiving Chernarus. All you’ll have when you start over again are the memories of your final mistake.\n- Meet Others..Up to 60 players are struggling to survive by any means necessary at any given time. Make friends, kill on sight, build a base, or risk being betrayed over a can of tasty beans. Use VOIP to interact with other players however you see fit. Every encounter is meaningful when your life is always on the line. Be wary. Stay alert. Trust no one.\n- Survive Chernarus..The infected aren’t the only ones you need to worry about – there’s also the wildlife and elements. Evade packs of wolves and frenzied bears, find shelter from the punishing rain, search for light in the darkness of night. You’ll also need to master complex survival mechanics concerning your hunger, thirst, body temperature, and more.\n- Loot Up..Always make sure your gear is ready. Patch up damaged clothes, craft improvised items, and head out to deceptively dead cities to scavenge for valuable resources. Fix a car and hide it in your secret base under a cover of well-placed traps. Step into contaminated zones if you dare and keep your eyes peeled for precious loot. Don’t forget that you won’t get far without a full hazard suit and gas mask.\n- Take your Shot..Intense PvP action can break out anywhere at any time, especially in hotspots like abandoned military bases, where heart-pounding firefights are all the rage. Some survivors want your loot, others are simply hunting for sport. Then there are those who are afraid you’ll shoot first. Learn how to fight and know when the time has come to swallow your pride and flee. One bullet can change absolutely everything. Always watch your back.\n- Install Mods..Head on over to the Steam Workshop and find a customized server that fits. Join an active community of like-minded players and modify your DayZ experience to suit your taste.

  "about": "- END OF THE ROAD..Since the premiere, Frostpunk has been enriched with a number of updates. You can enjoy the new Endless Mode (with 3 ways of playing it) that increases the replayability of the game. There is also a new scenario - The Fall of Winterhome, that further expands the game’s universe and lore. And for the dessert, we’ve added things like naming characters and automatons and finally a photo mode. All of this is available for free for all the owners of the game. There are also three expansions, available with the paid Season Pass. At the same time we would like to inform you that we are not planning to create any more content for Frostpunk, as this journey is over for us, but there are more to come in the future, so be sure to keep an eye out for our games. Of course the game will still receive patches and fixes and we’ll provide the technical support.\n- SEASON PASS..The Official Season Pass for Frostpunk is out and complete! It grants you access to all additional content released for the game since the premiere, including three expansions (The Last Autumn, On The Edge and The Rifts), that widely broaden the main story and fill a lot of gaps in the game’s universe. What’s more, when you’re done with the game itself, you’ll be able to unwind while listening to the Digital Soundtrack featuring orchestrated music or learn more about the world with the exclusive Digital Artbook.\nCLICK FOR MORE SEASON PASS INFO.\nNot having the game at all? Worry no more, as the Frostpunk: Game of the Year Edition is what you are looking for. It includes the main game, season pass and all exclusive content at a discounted price.\n- THE CITY MUST SURVIVE..Frostpunk, the newest title from the creators of This War of Mine, is a society survival game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive.\nOptimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.\nWhat decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process?.\n- MAKE THE LAW..Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe.\n- SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY..If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist.\n or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back.\n- WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES..Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden.\n- DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES..Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.\n- EXPLORE THE FROSTLAND..While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.\n- PLAY ENDLESSLY..Frostpunk Endless Mode grants you unlimited replayability for the game. Play on 8 various maps, with different terrain, weather conditions and challenges to face. We know that different people look for different experiences and that’s why there are 3 modes to play in Endless Mode. Endurance will be an ultimate test to your building, managing and survival skills in the harshest conditions. Builders, where there is no generator available from the start, which creates a different type of challenge. And last but not least, Serenity which is focused on enjoying the art of building the city itself, without unnecessary pressure. ",

  "about": "RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller. Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune.\n+ You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world.- Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions.- Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more.- Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses.- Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others.- Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines.- Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials.- Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts.- Trade with passing ships and caravans.- Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony.- Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires.- Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery.- Discover a new generated world each time you play.- Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop.- Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor.RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.\nYour colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.\nEach person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.\nColonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.\nThe game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.\nTravel across the planet. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.\nYou can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.\nPeople in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.\nWounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.\nYou can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.",

Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored.\nSpace Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed.

Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future.\nSpace Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well.

Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is the new co-op focused experience from the award-winning team behind the Vermintide series.\nIn the depths of the hive, the seeds of corruption threaten to turn into an overwhelming tide of darkness. A mysterious and sinister new force is seeking to take control of the entire city. It is up to you and your allies in the Inquisition to root out the enemy before the city succumbs to Chaos.\nAs Tertium falls, Rejects Will Rise.\nBuilt on the legacy of Vermintide 2’s best-in-class melee combat, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide introduces intense WH40K gunplay to the mix.

More than that, your innate toughness – your determination to press on through the pain – only recharges when you are in the proximity of your strike team.\nCreate your own, unique character and customize their physical appearance, voice, and origin.

From boiling hot industrial factories to the decaying water maintenance zone afflicted by constant acid rainfall - Tertium Hive is a hard and unforgiving place even at the best of times. Your role is to serve the zealous Inquisition by embarking on missions to exterminate the threats lurking in the depths of the hive city, or die trying.\nAdapt to the erratic whims of Chaos with conditions- mutators that add a spontaneous challenge to your mission. Your team must learn to adjust, adopt new tactics and change up their loadouts to face these ruthless challenges.",
